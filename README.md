This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Simple create-react-app to test [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/faqs#can-i-nest-rules) in combination with [React's "new" Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

## Example: Theme switcher
Using the new context API to switch between a ![#663399](https://placehold.it/15/663399/000000?text=+) `Purple` and ![#ffd700](https://placehold.it/15/ffd700/000000?text=+) `Yellow` theme.
